# MethSig
Processes bisulfite sequencing data and performs epidriver inference.

## Getting Ready

## Step 1: Estimate expected hypermethylation of tumor sample (expected DHcR)
## Step 2: Evaluate if observed DHcR is significantly higher than expected DHcR
## Step 3: Determine if promoter hypermethylation if overrepresnted in patients (epidriver)
