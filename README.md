# MethSig
Processes bisulfite sequencing data and performs epidriver inference.

## Getting Ready

## Usage
pBeta is used to:
 1. Estimate expected hypermethylation of tumor sample (expected DHcR);
 2. Evaluate if observed DHcR is significantly higher than expected DHcR.
pCombine is used to:
 1. Determine if promoter hypermethylation if overrepresnted in patients (epidriver).
