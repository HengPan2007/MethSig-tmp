# MethSig
Process bisulfite sequencing data and performs epidriver inference.

## Getting Ready

## 
pBeta: Estimate expected hypermethylation of tumor sample (expected DHcR) and evaluate if observed DHcR is significantly higher than expected DHcR.

pCombine: Determine if promoter hypermethylation if overrepresnted in patients (epidriver).
